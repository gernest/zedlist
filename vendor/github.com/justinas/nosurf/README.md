# nosurf

`nosurf` is an HTTP package for Go
that helps you prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
It acts like a middleware and therefore 
is compatible with basically any Go HTTP application.

### Why?
Even though CSRF is a prominent vulnerability,
Go's web-related package infrastructure mostly consists of
micro-frameworks that neither do implement CSRF checks,
nor should they.

`nosurf` solves this problem by proving a `CSRFHandler`
that wraps your `http.Handler` and checks for CSRF attacks
on every non-safe (non-GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE) method.


### Features

* Supports any `http.Handler` (frameworks, your own handlers, etc.)
and acts like one itself.
* Allows exempting specific endpoints from CSRF checks by
an exact URL, a glob, or a regular expression.
* Allows specifying your own failure handler. 
Want to present the hacker with an ASCII middle finger
instead of the plain old `HTTP 400`? No problem.
* Has no dependencies outside the Go standard library.

### Example
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/justinas/nosurf"
	"html/template"
	"net/http"
)

var templateString string = `
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
{{ if .name }}
<p>Your name: {{ .name }}</p>
{{ end }}
<form action="/" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="name">

<!-- Try removing this or changing its value
     and see what happens -->
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ .token }}">
<input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
</body>
</html>
`
var templ = template.Must(template.New("t1").Parse(templateString))

func myFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	context := make(map[string]string)
	context["token"] = nosurf.Token(r)
	if r.Method == "POST" {
		context["name"] = r.FormValue("name")
	}
	
	templ.Execute(w, context)
}

func main() {
	myHandler := http.HandlerFunc(myFunc)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nosurf.New(myHandler))
	fmt.Println("Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000/")
}
```

Feel free to add one for your favorite framework 
or an unusual setup of the default HTTP tools.
